	<p>Well I've heard there was a secret chord
	That David played and it pleased the Lord
	But you don't really care for music, do you?
	Well it goes like this:
	The fourth, the fifth, the minor fall and the major lift
	The baffled king composing Hallelujah
    </p>
	<pre>
	Hallelujah
	Hallelujah
	Hallelujah
	Hallelujah</pre>

	<p>Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
	You saw her bathing on the roof
	Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
	She tied you to her kitchen chair
	And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
	And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
    </p>
    <pre>
	Hallelujah
	Hallelujah
	Hallelujah
	Hallelujah
    </pre>
